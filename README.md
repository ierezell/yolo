# GTFO-Like Multiplayer Game

This project implements a GTFO-like cooperative survival horror game using Bevy and Lightyear for multiplayer networking.

## ✅ Current Status - FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The game is now **fully functional** with both single-player and multiplayer capabilities:

- ✅ **Multiplayer networking** using Lightyear 0.23.0
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** with 100% passing tests
- ✅ **Multiple launch modes** (single-player, client, server, host-client)
- ✅ **Optimized compilation** for faster development
- ✅ **Clean codebase** with all warnings removed

## 🎮 Launch Modes

The game supports multiple launch modes via command line arguments:

### Single Player Mode (Default)
```bash
cargo run
# or explicitly
cargo run -- 
```
Starts the game in single-player mode with local player controls.

### Client Mode
```bash
cargo run -- client --client-id 1
# Connect to specific server
cargo run -- -s 192.168.1.100 -p 5000 client --client-id 1
```
Connects to a multiplayer server as a client.

### Server Mode
```bash
cargo run -- server
# Custom port
cargo run -- -p 7777 server
```
Starts a dedicated multiplayer server.

### Host Client Mode
```bash
cargo run -- host-client --client-id 0
```
Runs both server and client in the same process (ideal for testing).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The game features a robust multiplayer architecture with:

### Shared Code (`shared.rs`)
- ✅ Consistent movement logic (client and server)
- ✅ Physics integration with Avian3D
- ✅ Shared game constants and calculations

### Protocol (`protocol.rs`) 
- ✅ Network component definitions (PlayerPosition, PlayerHealth, etc.)
- ✅ Message definitions (WeaponFire, PlayerConnected, etc.)
- ✅ Input action definitions using leafwing-input-manager
- ✅ Channel configurations for reliable/unreliable data

### Client (`client.rs`)
- ✅ Input handling and prediction
- ✅ Entity interpolation for smooth remote players
- ✅ Observer-based event handling

### Server (`server.rs`)
- ✅ Authoritative game simulation
- ✅ Player connection/disconnection handling
- ✅ Physics and combat authority

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run only multiplayer tests
cargo test --test multiplayer_tests

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Component serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Player entity spawning and management
- ✅ Message handling and networking protocol
- ✅ Enemy type definitions
- ✅ Transform component updates
- ✅ Integration tests for basic multiplayer setup

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

The project includes several optimizations for faster development:

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1           # Basic optimizations for main code

[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 3           # Full optimizations for dependencies
```

This significantly reduces compilation time while maintaining good runtime performance during development.

## 🎯 Controls

- **WASD**: Move
- **Mouse**: Look around  
- **Left Click**: Fire weapon
- **Right Click**: Aim down sights
- **R**: Reload
- **F**: Toggle flashlight

- **Ctrl**: Crouch
- **Space**: Jump
- **E**: Interact

## 🛠️ Development

### Building
```bash
# Standard build
cargo build

# Release build
cargo build --release

# Check for errors without building
cargo check
```

### Features
