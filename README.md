## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gtfo-like-game
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

### Development

For development with faster compile times, this project includes several optimizations:

#### Fast Compilation Setup
The project is configured with optimizations from the [Bevy Setup Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/):

- **Dynamic linking**: Bevy uses dynamic linking in debug builds for faster iteration
- **Optimized dependencies**: Dependencies are compiled with `opt-level = 3` while your code uses `opt-level = 1`
- **LLD linker**: Uses rust-lld for faster linking on Windows
- **Incremental compilation**: Enabled for faster rebuilds

#### Development Commands
```bash
# Run in development mode (faster compilation)
cargo run

# Run specific binary
cargo run --bin full   # Full game with all systems
cargo run --bin simple # Simple test scene

# Build with optimizations for testing
cargo run --release

# Quick compilation check without linking
cargo check

# Watch for changes and auto-rebuild (install with: cargo install cargo-watch)
cargo watch -x run
```

#### Development Scripts
For convenience, use the provided development scripts:

**Windows Batch:**
```cmd
dev-run.bat
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\dev-run.ps1
```

These scripts automatically set optimization flags and build the project.

#### Additional Performance Tips
- **SSD recommended**: Place the project on an SSD for faster I/O
- **RAM**: 16GB+ recommended for comfortable development  
- **Parallel compilation**: The project uses all available CPU cores
- **Dynamic linking**: Enabled by default for faster development builds
